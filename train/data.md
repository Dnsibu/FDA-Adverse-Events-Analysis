The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is an American government agency that ensures public health and safety by regulating drugs, biological products, medical devices, radiological products, food, and cosmetics. The Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition (CFSAN) is a branch of the FDA that runs a safety surveillance program which involves recording data on adverse food incidents in a database known as the CFSAN Adverse Event Reporting System (CAERS). This database includes voluntary information reported to the FDA by healthcare professionals and consumers regarding adverse food events and product complaints. According to the FDA, if a consumer product is identified as dangerous through CAERS, the FDA may take regulatory action(s) to improve product safety and protect the public health, communicate new safety information to the public, or, in rare cases, remove a product from the market.
	The FDA has hired your team of data scientists to analyze the CAERS data, identify potentially dangerous consumer products and patterns, and provide recommended regulatory actions to the FDA. To accomplish this, you have been given access to all Product-Based CAERS data from January 2004-June 2023 (CAERS_ProductBased.csv), which contains information on products that have caused adverse events and the medical outcomes of these events. Successful teams will consider the outcomes of each of these events alongside the demographic information provided in the CAERS data to identify potentially dangerous products/product categories and patterns that require FDA attention.
