# FDA-Adverse-Events-Analysis ðŸ“Š

My inspiration for this project stemmed from my passionate interest in public health and safety. The realization that consumer products regulated by the FDA, though generally safe, can occasionally lead to adverse events sparked a curiosity to delve deeper into this area. The goal of mine was to leverage data analytics to uncover patterns and insights that could potentially help in improving product safety standards and contribute to the well-being of consumers.

The project was built using a combination of Python, and python libraries such as Pandas for data manipulation, and Matplotlib for data visualization. The dataset was the CAERS_ProductBased.csv data from January 2004 to June 2023, which provided 20 years of  rich source of information on consumer product-related adverse events. The process involved cleaning the data, categorizing outcomes based on severity, and analyzing the frequency of these events.
